# Part1: Imaging Technique Inspiration
In this work, I was inspired by Summer Wars, a work by Japanese anime director Mamoru Hosoda. In the story, OZ is a virtual world that integrates many businesses, allowing for a wide range of activities. This also reminded me of the internet around us. When we view the people and things around us as IP addresses, we can connect with them. In this work, I wanted to use simple geometric shapes and animation to create a magical scene of data exchange.
