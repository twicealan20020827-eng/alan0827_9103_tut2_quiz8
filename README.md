# Part1: Imaging Technique Inspiration
In this work, I was inspired by Summer Wars, a work by Japanese anime director Mamoru Hosoda. In the story, OZ is a virtual world that integrates many businesses, allowing for a wide range of activities. This also reminded me of the internet around us. When we view the people and things around us as IP addresses, we can connect with them. In this work, I wanted to use simple geometric shapes and animation to create a magical scene of data exchange.

# Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration
I found the geometric motion animation in MDM. To create a multi-graphic animation effect, you can use Animation-name: to achieve the goal. Then, use the  translate() function to create positional changes. This makes web animations more vivid and engaging.
The code’s random spawning and morphing of shapes could be adapted to simulate IOT “transition” or abstract perception shifts, supporting a re-enchanted or immersive visual experience.
