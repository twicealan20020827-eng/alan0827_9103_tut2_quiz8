# Part1: Imaging Technique Inspiration
In this work, I was inspired by Summer Wars, a work by Japanese anime director Mamoru Hosoda. In the story, OZ is a virtual world that integrates many businesses, allowing for a wide range of activities. This also reminded me of the internet around us. When we view the people and things around us as IP addresses, we can connect with them. In this work, I wanted to use simple geometric shapes and animation to create a magical scene of data exchange.

# Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration
I found some geometric motion animations in the work of OpenProcessing creator OKAZZ. To create a slowly moving shape animation, use the easeInOutExpo() function. Then, use the line(this.x, this.y, this.fromX, this.fromY); function to create a continuous movement effect. This makes the animation more dynamic and interesting.
The random generation and deformation of shapes in code can be used to simulate IoT "transitions" or shifts in abstract perception, creating an immersive visual experience.
